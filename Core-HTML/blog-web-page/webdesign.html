      Web design is the art and science of creating the visual and interactive
      elements of a website. It involves the use of layout, typography, color
      schemes, images, and other graphical elements to craft an aesthetically
      pleasing and user-friendly web experience. <br />
      Web designers focus on creating a cohesive and engaging design that aligns
      with the website's purpose and target audience. They collaborate with web
      developers to ensure that the design is technically feasible and
      functional. In today's digital world, web design is crucial for making a
      lasting first impression, enhancing user engagement, and delivering a
